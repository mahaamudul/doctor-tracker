### 2.2 Doctor Management
* **Admin can:**
  * Create a doctor with the following information:
    * Name
    * Specialization
    * Hospital
    * Phone
    * Email
  * View a list of all doctors.
  * Search doctors.
  * Filter doctors (date-wise and other relevant filters).
  * Paginate doctor records.
  * View corresponding patients for each doctor.
  * Add new patients under a specific doctor.
  * Delete patients from the doctor’s patient list.

### 2.3 Patient Management
* **Dedicated Patient Page:**
  * List all patients.
  * Edit patient information.
  * Delete patients.
  * **Implement:**
    * Pagination
    * Search functionality
    * Filtering (date-wise, patient-condition, and other relevant filters)

## 3. Dashboard & Data Visualization
* **Admin Dashboard should include:**
  * Visual representation of data.
  * **Analytics such as:**
    * Total doctors
    * Total patients
    * Patients per doctor
    * Date-based statistics
  * Charts and graphs (any suitable analytics library may be used).
* **Focus on:**
  * Clean data aggregation
  * Optimized query performance

* **Frontend & Backend Framework:** Next.js (Full-stack inside Next.js application)
* **Database:** MongoDB
* **Backend Technologies:** Node.js, Express (integrated within Next.js architecture)
* RESTful API design principles
* Proper state management and data fetching strategies

---

## 7. Evaluation Criteria
The project will be evaluated based on:

## README Requirements (Standardized Template)
The `README.md` is the primary technical documentation. It must include:

| Section | Requirement |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Description** | A one-paragraph "Elevator Pitch" for the app's purpose. |
| **Setup Guide** | Step-by-step local installation. Must include an `.env.example` file. |
| **System Architecture** | A high-level overview of the data flow and service interactions. |
| **Technical Decisions** | Deep dive into 2 specific decisions (e.g., "Why we chose Redux over Context API"). |
| **Visual Evidence** | High-quality screenshots of the UI (Desktop & Mobile views). |

> **Note:** Submit your project link and GitHub repo with credentials if required.
